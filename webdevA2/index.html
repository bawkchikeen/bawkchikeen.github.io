                Hopefully you haven't just survived something horrendous and are now stranded on some strange island
                with nothing
                but the clothes on your back.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you're in luck! <br> You've somehow stumbled onto my humble site despite the fact that you
                shouldn't have any internet, and now I shall regale you with the knowledge that I have which
                could save your life!
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in truth I only have knowledge on how to obtain food fit for human consumption...

                So, if you need information on the other aspects of survival there are many other sources out there:

                Foraging
            </h1>
            <p>
                Foraging is one of the most basic ways to get edible food while in the wild. Foraging involves
                identifying and harvesting wild edibles while avoiding the poisonous ones. Wild edibles could be
                anything from berries to mushrooms to even flowers!
            </p>

                <h2>
                    Common Wild Edibles

                <div class="flexItem">
                <p>
                    Cattails are common and easy to harvest, but they also have a poisonous look-alike, the Iris
                    plant.<br>The Iris is flat at the base and makes a fan shape where all the leave meet the ground,
                    while edible Cattails have a central vein called a midrib around which its leaves form.<br>Here's a
                    video showing more common and useful Wild Edibles for survival!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another common plant that is edible is the Dandelion! Even though they're fairly common, I was
                    personally surprised that this humble flower is actually something many people use to make salads
                    with!

                Fishing
            </h1>
            <p>
                Fishing comes in many forms, not just the typical fishing rod and hook! Although we'll be doing that
                later, I was thinking we should look at one other forms of 'fishing'!

                    Trapping!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With just the concept of baiting and funnelling, you can create really simple traps to catch fish! A
                    really simple one to keep in mind is to use plastic bottles, big or small both work. Simply cut then
                    fold in the top of a bottle to create a funnel, then put bait in it. Bait doesn't have to be anyhing
                    fancy! Whatever you have leftover is usually good enough :D

                    As shown in the video, there are many useful materials out there in the wild for us to take
                    advantage of, we simply need the know how! Dry grass is also a viable material for creating rope, as
                    long as you can get long strands of some kind of fibre, you could probably create a rudimentary but
                    useful fishing rod!
