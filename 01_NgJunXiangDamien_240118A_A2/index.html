                Hopefully you haven't just survived something horrendous and are now stranded on some strange island
                with nothing
                but the clothes on your back.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you're in luck! <br> You've somehow stumbled onto my humble site despite the fact that you
                shouldn't have any internet, and now I shall regale you with the knowledge that I have which
                <i>could</i> save your life!
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in truth I only have knowledge on how to obtain food fit for human consumption...

                Foraging
            </h1>
            <p>
                Foraging is one of the most basic ways to get edible food while in the wild. Foraging involves
                identifying and harvesting wild edibles while avoiding the poisonous ones. Wild edibles could be
                anything from berries to mushrooms to even flowers!

                    Common Wild Edibles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cattails are common and easy to harvest, but they also have a poisonous look-alike, the Iris
                    plant.<br>The Iris is flat at the base and makes a fan shape where all the leave meet the ground,
                    while edible Cattails have a central vein called a midrib around which its leaves form.<br>Here's a
                    video showing more common and useful Wild Edibles for survival!
